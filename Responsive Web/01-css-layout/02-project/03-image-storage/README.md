## Specs
You are an active photographer, you want to create responsive image storage to make it easier for you and others to find those images

- Use the templates provided in the `index.html` and `style.css` files. **Don't make changes to the html file**
- We will create a responsive web with `flexbox`, `grid`, and `@media`
- Use display `flex` on class `container` to make them horizontally aligned
- Make your code in style.css
- Create `display:grid` for class `image`
- Use `grid-template-columns` in the `image` class to set the column for each item in the class
- Make a media query for breakpoints at a minimum size of 700px and above
- Change display `flex` in class `container` to `grid`
- Make it look responsive for PC and cellphone devices
- Use Dev Tools to check what's wrong with that code
